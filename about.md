# About
This is a collection of random things I've found while exploring or in my day to day. It's a bit of a miscellaneous bucket, where I've dumped various notes, snippets, and tidbits that might be helpful or interesting to someone else.

You'll find a mix of useful information, not so useful information, and possibly some outdated or obsolete stuff. I've made no attempt to organize this content or make it formal, so you can either dig through it to find what you're looking for or just look around.

If you stumble upon something that's helpful or sparks your interest, that's great! If not, well, at least it's here in case someone else needs it :)

Here's a drawing of a cat:
